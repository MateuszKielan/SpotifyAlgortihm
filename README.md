This project is about creating a spotify algorithm for the "Discover weekly feature"
It consists of 3 parts:
  1. In the first part we generate 5 songs based on the songs that user listend to
  2. In the second part we generate 5 songs based on the users favourite genre
  3. In the third part we generate 5 songs based on the users mood
  
File structure:
  1. spotify_dataset.csv: represents the dataset od the songs that we are working with in the program
  2. main.py: is used for dataset handling/cleaning, input/output of the program and connecting several parts of the program togeather
  3. task1.py | task2.py | task3.py: they correspond to 1st 2nd and 3rd part of the project described above.
  
How to open the project:
  1. Open the main.py and run it.
  2. When running main.py you will get an message to input the file name in the terminal. You can choose any name.
  3. After that press enter and a txt file will appear in the directory. This is the file with output for all 3 tasks.
